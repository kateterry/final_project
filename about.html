                <h4>8/14/2016</h4>
                <p>There are dozens of us! DOZENS! Teamocil. Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit.

If you need me, I'll be at the bar. There's a new daddy in town. A discipline daddy. I'll have a vodka rocks. (Mom, it's breakfast time.) And a piece of toast.</p>
