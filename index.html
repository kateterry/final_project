  <h3>The Concept of 'Pieces'</h3>
  <h4>8/14/2016</h4>
    <p>There are dozens of us! DOZENS! Teamocil. Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit. I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. I'm tired of trying to find happiness through lies and self-medicating. If you need me, I'll be at the bar. There's a new daddy in town. A discipline daddy. I'll have a vodka rocks. (Mom, it's breakfast time.) And a piece of toast.</p>

    <p>Everyone's laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster. Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. Oh, hi, Mom. I have the afternoon free. Really? Did "nothing" cancel? No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. Oh, yeah, the guy in the the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! I made a huge tiny mistake.</p>

    <p>Family Love Michael. Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball and remain motionless when confronted. Even though sooooo many people in this office are begging for it. I want to cry so bad, but I don't think I can spare the moisture. Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. There are dozens of us! DOZENS! I made a huge tiny mistake. Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons.</p>

  <p>Teamocil. Oh Gob, you could charm the black off a telegram boy. Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. Speaking of settling, How's Ann? Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup. I think the only time you cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died. You gave us cereal in an ashtray.</p>
